					<p><em>"With guidance and instruction from Lee I've achieved things that I didn't think were possible! He's transformed the way I live, the way I look at food and he's educated me so much in the field of exercise and fitness."</em> <strong>- N.L., Kent</strong>

					<p><em>"After trying out (unsuccessfully) a few personal trainers in the past, I was a little sceptical about what Lee could offer me. His knowledge and the way he applies his knowledge to make our training sessions varied, fun and effective never ceases to amaze me. I would recommend Lee without an ounce of hesitation."</em><strong>- Debbie, Ashford</strong>
