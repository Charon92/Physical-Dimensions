<h1>Challenges</h1>
<p class="dark-text">Ever wondered if you could complete the notorious SAS 'Long Drag'? Or complete the Welsh 3000's? Or perhaps a 'Marathon Des Sables' type event? Perhaps that's a bit extreme, and you'd like to start with a challenging night ascent of Mt. Snowdon instead. Well if you have, you've found the right place. Physical Dimensions plans and supervises bespoke adventure challenges designed to our clients specification. We'll find you the right location, design your challenge or event, complete a risk assessment, map the area, arrange accommodation (if required) and sort out transport to and from the venue.</p>
<br />

 <p class="dark-text">All you need to do is tell us how tough you want it, how many will be taking part and what your budget is then leave the rest to us. We'll consult with you at every step of the way to ensure that you're happy with our arrangements. Adventure challenges can be great for corporate team building, alternative stag or hen parties or simply to settle a bet with a group of friends. So if you're looking for a sense of adventure, call or email Lee.</p>

        <h3>S.A.S Long Drag</h3>
        <p class="dark-text">The 'Long Drag' is the finale to the battery of endurance tests endured by S.A.S hopefuls. It is a grueling 40 mile hike, performed in 20 hours, all with a 55 lbs rucksack. The 40 miles happens to be located along a particularly rough stretch of The Brecon Beacons, an already treacherous task. Think you're up for the challenge? Bring along your mates or work collegues and find out who's got what it takes.</p>

        <h3>Welsh 3000's</h3>
        <p class="dark-text">There are 14 (some say 15) peaks in Wales that reach above 3000 feet, your job will be to climb these in 24 hours without using any means of transport other than yourself. A challenged likened to The Three Peaks, it is a course that equates to over 30 miles in length and features the toughest mountain walking/climbing that Wales has to offer.</p>

        <h3>Stag and Hen Parties</h3>
        <p class="dark-text">For some the idea of a 'typical' stag or hen party makes their stomach turn, particularly those fitness orientated among us. How about a tailor-made adventure challenge weekend instead? You could choose to climb a mountain, go kayaking in the lake district or any number of challenges that await you out there.</p>

        <h3 id="white-text-header">Climbing Snowdon</h3>
        	<p>Snowdonia is home to numerous challenging peaks, but none more so than its namesake, Mount Snowdon. Formed from ancient volcanic rock and carved into shape by millenia of glaciation, this ancient giant is the busiest mountain in Britain, attracting everyone from amateur walkers to experienced rock climbers. It is also a designated national nature reserve, for the abundance of rare flora and fauna
.</p>
			<br />
			<p>This unique environment along with the incredible walks make it a perfect candidate for night climbs. With the crisp mountain air, crystal moonlight, the walk will be both challenging and breathtaking (physically and emotionally) as we summit to catch a glimpse of the view of wilderness under the stars.</p>
