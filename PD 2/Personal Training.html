            				<p>Of all the issues surrounding health and fitness, nothing confuses people more than nutrition. For many, nutrition appears to be some dark art, and with all the mixed messages we're subjected to on a daily basis, it's not all together surprising.</p> <br  />
                            <p>But exercise and diet are really just opposite sides of the same coin – one relates to the energy expenditure, the other the energy intake; and when you understand the golden rules of nutrition, it can be quite a powerful tool.</p>

 							<p >At Physical Dimensions we offer a full nutritional analysis of your diet; looking at the ratios and quantities of macronutrients and identifying any deficiencies or excesses of your micronutrients. We look at your fluid intake and times of the day when your meals are consumed; and when we have all the required information we write you a bespoke nutrition plan designed specifically to help you reach your goals. What's more, we'll give you an in-depth explanation as to what roles the different food groups play and explain the many benefits of what eating a balanced diet can deliver.</p>
